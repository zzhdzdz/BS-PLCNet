Abstract:
Packet loss is a common and unavoidable problem in voice over internet phone (VoIP) systems. To deal with the problem, we propose a band-split packet loss concealment network (BS-PLCNet). Specifically, we split the full-band signal into wide-band (0-8kHz) and high-band (8-24kHz). The wide-band signals are processed by a gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN), while the high-band counterpart is processed by a simple GRU network. To ensure high speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) compatibility, multi-task learning (MTL) framework including fundamental frequency (f0) prediction, linguistic awareness, and multi-discriminators are used. The proposed approach tied for $1^{st}$ place in the ICASSP 2024 PLC Challenge.
