Abstract:
Packet loss is a common and unavoidable problem in voice over internet phone (VoIP) systems. Specifically, we split the full-band signal into wide-band (0-8kHz) and high-band (8-24kHz). The wide-band signals are processed by a gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN), while the high-band counterpart is processed by a simple GRU network. Multi-task training including fundamental frequency (f0) prediction, linguistic awareness, and multi-discriminators are used to ensure high speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) compatibility. The proposed approach tied for $1^{st}$ place in the ICASSP 2024 PLC Challenge.
